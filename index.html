    <p>The 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers won the franchise’s fourth Super Bowl in the 1970s, but nearly lost the title game to an underdog Rams team. The Chuck Noll-coached Steelers – which led the NFL in scoring offense, went 12-4 during the regular season and won the AFC Central. The Steelers beat the Dolphins, 34-14 in the AFC Divisional Round and the Oilers, 27-13 in the AFC Championship. The Steelers trailed the Rams, 19-17 entering the 4th quarter of Super Bowl XIV. But a 73-yard TD reception by John Stallworth and a Franco Harris rushing TD sealed the win. This Pittsburgh Hall of Fame cast on offense included Mike Webster at center and Terry Bradshaw at quarterback (3,724 yards passing, 26 TD throws); running back Franco Harris (1,186 rushing yards, 11 rushing TDs); and wide receivers John Stallworth (1,183 receiving yards, eight TD catches) and Lynn Swann (808 receiving yards, five TD catches.)
